The top-level readme has been generated from the content here.

Code-snippets are extracted from `testdata`, and the readme template is located in `template`

The command to create the top-level from here would be

```bash
snippet -s testdata -t template/readme.md -o ..
```

The following command is equivalent, in this case.

```bash
snippet -s testdata -t template -o ..
```
